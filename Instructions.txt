of a technical test

Comments:
	Assumes no Validation is Required, including blank files etc (As stated in the brief).
	Does not pick an optimized path through the "sparse" test.
	Assumes only one solution is required. The brief is a bit ambiguous on this point.
	  (Do mazes only ever have one available solution? do I need to find every possible solution?)
	  I concluded only one solution from the wording.

Instructions:
	Requires JDK and for the Java System Path Variable to be set in order to Run!

	Test Files located in MazeTest/build/res Folder (They must be here)
	Edit the value of the "file" variable in run.bat with the .txt file you wish to run (currently set to medium_input.txt)
	Double click on run.bat
